## What does the application do?

The script should be an example how the convolution works in code, picturing the video above. So we have two signals, which are convolved with each other and also you can choose if you want to see the points where they overlap by setting the 'overlap' variable of True and also you can just do a circular convolution (range the new signal) by setting periodic of True.
